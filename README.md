### Hi folks..

I'm [Ian Fleming](http://www.ianflemingdeveloper.com). (No, not that Ian Fleming)

<br/>

I'm a certified web developer with a background in intellectual property law and retail management. I love finding solutions to problems, and show incredible persistence and perseverance in doing so. I particularly enjoy working with React, Node / Express + API configuration, MongoDB, some GraphQL, a little SQL and Firebase. I work hard daily on extending this list. 

<br/>

When not working or coding, you'll find me making electronic music, playing guitar, running, reading, or trying desperately to figure out how to be the best father in the world.
